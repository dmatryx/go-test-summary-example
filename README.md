# go-test-summary-example

This repo is a simple demonstration of https://github.com/dmatryx/go-test-summary as a github action.

The repo doesn't do anything special, but it is a simple go app with some tests within.

Currently the tests are set to include failures to demonstrate the behaviour of the workflows.

There are two workflows within - one long and one short form so the difference can be easily observed.
