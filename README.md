# go-test-summary-example

This repo is a simple demonstration of https://github.com/dmatryx/go-test-summary as a github action.

The repo doesn't do anything special, but it is a simple go app with some tests within.

If the action output here has expired, please review the main action repo for images of the output

Currently the tests are set to include failures to demonstrate the behaviour of the workflows.

There are two workflows within - one long and one short form so the difference can be easily observed.
